# A-cool-looking-box-MDN

This is my version of MDN's Assessment: A cool looking box

The objective of this assignment is "to text comprehension
of the CSS box model and other box-related features such as borders and backgrounds". This is tested by having one attempt
to create a cool looking box with rules and a example screenshot given.
